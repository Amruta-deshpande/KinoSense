Enabling Smart Phones making Sense by itself

Terminologies
===========

We need to understand the following terminologies

* Triggers
* Actions
* Rules
* Profiles

Triggers
----
Triggers can be both low level or high level. An Accelerometer event can be a low level trigger. A User flipping the phone facedown can be a high level triggers. Triggers are to be used alone or in conjuction and actions needs to be fired when triggers fulfill a set of rules

Actions
----
Actions can be low level or high level. Phone going on Silent mode can be low level action. A User phone is silent mode, but phone calls answered by auto reply SMS "Busy in meeting" can be considered a high level "Do not Distrub" Action

Rules
----
Rules is nothing but fulfillment of set of Triggers (and may be some context). If rules are fulfilled appropriate actions should be fired

Profiles
----
Profiles are templates which are in term set of rules. A User can create various profiles or clone some well known profiles. This way user does not have to manage individual rules
